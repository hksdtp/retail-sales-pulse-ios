# Team Permission Logic Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Objective**
Fix team task visibility permissions in TaskManagementView component to ensure proper access control for different user roles.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Enhanced Team Selection Permission Check**
**File**: `src/components/tasks/TaskManagementView.tsx`
**Lines**: 420-450

**Before**: No permission check when selecting teams
**After**: Added permission check for regular team members

```typescript
// PERMISSION CHECK: Team members can only see tasks from their own team
if (isRegularMember && selectedTeamId !== currentUserTeamId) {
  console.log(`🚫 Access denied: Team member ${currentUser?.name} (team ${currentUserTeamId}) cannot access team ${selectedTeamId}`);
  return false;
}
```

### 2. **Fixed Dependency Array**
**File**: `src/components/tasks/TaskManagementView.tsx`
**Line**: 660

**Before**: Missing `selectedTeamForView` in dependency array
**After**: Added `selectedTeamForView` to ensure re-filtering when team selection changes

```typescript
}, [regularTaskData?.tasks, managerTaskData?.tasks, mockTasks, currentUser, users, teams, selectedLocation, selectedTeam, selectedMember, selectedMemberId, effectiveUser, selectedTeamForView]);
```

### 3. **Enhanced Task Team ID Checking**
**File**: `src/components/tasks/TaskManagementView.tsx`
**Lines**: 423-428

**Before**: Only checked `task.team_id`
**After**: Check both `task.team_id` and `task.teamId` fields

```typescript
// FIXED: Check both team_id and teamId fields
const taskTeamId = String(task.team_id || task.teamId || '');
const selectedTeamId = String(selectedTeamForView.id);
const currentUserTeamId = String(currentUser?.team_id || '');
```

### 4. **Added Test Data**
**File**: `packages/api-server/server.js`
**Lines**: 20-114

**Added**:
- 4 team-specific tasks (one for each team)
- 1 shared/department-wide task
- Proper `team_id` and `teamId` fields for all tasks

## 📋 **Permission Rules Implemented**

### **Director (Khổng Đức Mạnh)**
- ✅ Can see all teams
- ✅ Can access all team tasks
- ✅ Can see shared tasks

### **Team Leaders**
- ✅ Can see their own team only (in TeamCardsView)
- ✅ Can access their team tasks
- ✅ Can see shared tasks

### **Team Members (Regular Employees)**
- ✅ Can see their own team only (in TeamCardsView)
- ✅ Can access ONLY their own team tasks
- ❌ CANNOT access other teams' tasks
- ✅ Can see shared/department-wide tasks

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Director Access**
- **User**: Khổng Đức Mạnh
- **Expected**: Can see and access all 4 teams
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

### **Test Case 2: Team Member Access**
- **User**: Lê Khánh Duy (NHÓM 1 member)
- **Expected**: 
  - Can only see NHÓM 1 in team cards
  - Can access NHÓM 1 tasks
  - Cannot access NHÓM 2, 3, 4 tasks
  - Can see shared tasks
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

### **Test Case 3: Permission Denial**
- **User**: Any team member
- **Action**: Try to access different team
- **Expected**: Access denied with console log
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

## 📊 **Test Data Structure**

```javascript
// Team-specific tasks
{
  id: 'task-team1-1',
  title: 'Task của NHÓM 1 - VIỆT ANH',
  team_id: '1',
  teamId: '1',
  user_id: 'Ue4vzSj1KDg4vZyXwlHJ'
}

// Shared task
{
  id: 'task-shared-1',
  title: 'Task chung của phòng - Tất cả teams',
  team_id: '0',
  isSharedWithTeam: true,
  visibility: 'public',
  department_wide: true
}
```

## 🔍 **How to Test**

### **Manual Testing Steps**:
1. Login as **Lê Khánh Duy** (team member, NHÓM 1)
2. Navigate to **Công việc** → **Của nhóm**
3. Verify only **NHÓM 1 - VIỆT ANH** card is visible
4. Click on NHÓM 1 → Should show team 1 tasks + shared tasks
5. Try to access other teams → Should be blocked

### **Expected Console Logs**:
```
🚫 Access denied: Team member Lê Khánh Duy (team 1) cannot access team 2
👤 Regular user access: showing only team 1
```

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

- [x] Team members can only see their own team cards
- [x] Team members cannot access other teams' tasks
- [x] Team members can see shared/department tasks
- [x] Directors maintain full access
- [x] Team leaders maintain team access
- [x] Permission checks logged to console
- [x] Dependency array includes selectedTeamForView
- [x] Both team_id and teamId fields checked

## 🎉 **Result**

**Permission logic is now working correctly!** Team members are properly restricted to their own team while maintaining access to shared tasks and preserving director/team leader privileges.
